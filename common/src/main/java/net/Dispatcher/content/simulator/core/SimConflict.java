 * One detected scheduling conflict (SPEC §4.5). Identical repeats (same
 * resource, same trains) are merged: {@code startTick}/{@code endTick} span
 * the first occurrence and {@code count} says how often it repeated.
 * {@code trains} are engine train indexes, primary train first (the waiter /
 * follower / first dweller). {@code nonDeterministic} marks conflicts
 * involving live-snapshot-anchored trains or static obstacles — those depend
 * on the network state at the moment Simulate was pressed.
 * {@code anchorEdge}/{@code anchorOffset} is the graph-space location behind
 * {@code position}, so presentation can project it (e.g. onto the diagram).
